hammett
=======

hammett is a fast python test runner that is largely compatible with pytest.

It does not support class based tests at this time though.


Usage
------

First :code:`pip install hammett`, then in your tests change :code:`import pytest` to :code:`import hammett as pytest`. Hopefully your tests now run!

hammett works with some pytest plugins, most notably pytest-django, at least for some projects.
