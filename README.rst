hammett
=======

hammett is a fast python test runner with an API that tries to match pytest.


Usage
------

First :code:`pip install hammett`, then in your tests change :code:`import pytest` to :code:`import hammett as pytest`. Hopefully your tests now run!

hammett doesn't support pytest plugins.
